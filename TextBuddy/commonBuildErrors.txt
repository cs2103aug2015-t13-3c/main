Common Errors:

**************************************************

Syntax error: missing ';' before '*'

Possible Problem:
	Included two header files within each other,
	so they can't initialise one file without initialising the other
	i.e.
	In Command.h:
		#include"Feedback.h"
	In Feedback.h:
		#include"stdafx.h"
	In stdafx.h:
		#include"Task.h"
		#include"Command.h"

Solution:
	Include only what you need

**************************************************

unresolved external symbol "public: virtual void __thiscall Command::execute(void)" (?execute@Command@@UAEXXZ)

Possible Problem:
	Method declared in header file, but no definition in cpp file

Solution:
	Create a definition for the method in cpp file

error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol "private: static class History * History::theOne" (?theOne@History@@0PAV1@A)

Possible Problem:
	Static member declared but not initialised

Solution:
	Declare static member again in cpp file
	e.g.
	In header file: static History *theOne;
	In cpp file: History * History::theOne;
